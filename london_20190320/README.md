## Session Notes

### Topic 1 - 

### Topic 2 - How do you measure the value of threat modeling?

#### Objectives

* Making it easier to satisfy auditors
  * Every control that's needed -> Take value of control as value of threat model
* Persuade devs to adopt (audience)
  * Value in skilling up employees
    * More efficient delivery
    * Motivation
  * Collaboration is unquantifiable
* Product Owners
  * "Safe to market"
  * "Predictable delivery"

#### Discussions

* Threat model the enterprise
  * Acquisition
  * 3rd party
* OKRs as a driver, but what are the objectives?
* Objective: Has audience
  * Auditors
  * Regulation
  * Product Owners
  * Devs
* With embedded QA

#### What we learnt (key results)

* Control value (threat model value) = ( ALE before - ALE after) / (Cost of control or threat model)
* Threat modeling, if it feeds into another OKR, it becomes measurable (if that OKR is measurable)
* Look at AppSec findings and ask "where should this have been considered?"
  * If threat modeling is the answer, then value
  * For anything you have seen
  * Value is expressed in showing all ways biz could be damaged (R.C.A.)
* Key result: Pentest findings decrease 
  * Time of discovery of finding - if at end, then threat modeling would have saved money
